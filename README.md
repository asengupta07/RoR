# 🚀 Project Title

> Gladiators of the Colosseum: AI Warriors of Rome

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Problem Statement 2 - Unleash Blockchain gameplay with Monad

---

## 🎯 Objective

This project aims to deliver a strategic, AI-driven Web3 gaming experience that blends ancient Roman themes with on-chain asset ownership. By introducing intelligent, evolving gladiators and immersive PvP/PvE mechanics, it addresses the lack of depth and engagement in traditional blockchain games, serving both gamers and NFT collectors seeking meaningful, interactive gameplay.

## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
NA

### Team Members:  
- Arnab Sengupta [GitHub](https://github.com/asengupta07)

### Your Approach:  
We chose this problem to bring depth and strategy to Web3 gaming through AI-driven characters and Roman mythology. Our goal was to move beyond static NFTs and create a living, evolving experience.

We tackled challenges like seamless onboarding, gasless NFT minting, and designing strategic combat mechanics. A key breakthrough was the “Favor of the Gods” system, which turned simple buffs into dynamic, divine interactions that influence battle outcomes.
